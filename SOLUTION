Public to private num of hops
-------------------
1 hop
A single hop suggests that the communication between the public and private instances doesn't need to traverse any
external routers or network devices.Instead, the packets likely travel directly within the VPC infrastructure.


DNS queries from the private instance
-------------------
Yes,
Since the public instance has internet access, it can communicate with public DNS servers on the internet and
resolve DNS addresses of public websites.
The public and private instances are in the same VPC, which means they can communicate with each other over
the private network within the VPC, even though the private instance doesn't have direct internet access.
When I connect to the private instance through the public instance, I essentially establish a network path
between the two instances within the VPC.
Once connected to the private instance via the public instance, I can configure the private instance to use
the public instance as a DNS resolver. This means that when the private instance needs to resolve a public DNS address,
it will send the DNS query to the public instance, which can then forward the query to public DNS servers on
the internet and relay the response back to the private instance.
In this setup, the public instance acts as a gateway or intermediary for DNS resolution,
allowing the private instance to leverage the public instance's internet access and connectivity to public DNS servers.
